Road signs recognition in R: pre- and post-Neural Networks approaches  
The goal of this paper is to show the advancing in image recognition approaches, comparing some famous algorithms used before the arrival of Neural Networks and the Convolutional Neural Networks  
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients  
- Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (followed by K-means)  
- Convolutional Neural Network  
Computational times made on an i7-8565U up to 4.6 GHz
